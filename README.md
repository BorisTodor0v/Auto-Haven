# Auto Haven

Auto Haven is a Godot game inspired by the classic Facebook game "Car Town". In this game the player owns a garage where they repair cars for money, which can be used to expand & decorate the garage, as well as buying cars to expand their collection. You can also participate in drag races against opponents to earn various rewards.

# How to Play?
Click on cars that appear next to the garage to begin repairing them. After their repair is complete, click on them again to claim your rewards. To move the camera while at the garage use WASD and Q/E to rotate it.

During races, the player has to reach the finish line as fast as possible. To do that they need to time their gearshifts optimally before their RPM reaches the redline, otherwise they will lose time. They will also need a fast car to beat out the opposition. The player can spend a lot of money to buy a fast car, or they can take a slower can and upgrade it piece by piece to make it faster than stock.
