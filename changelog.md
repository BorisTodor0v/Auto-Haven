- Fixed bug that disabled moving decor/furniture items when redecorating garage.
- Fixed bug that would register clicking on objects in the garage scene while the player is in a different location.
- Fixed bug that would desync the number of mechanics when a job car is spawned and immediately it's repair is started.
- Made player Rep affect how often job cars are spawned
	- Job cars are spawned between a minimum and maximum amount of seconds. Every 1000 rep the player earns the maximum time to spawn a new job car is reduced slightly.
- Save data is now stored in the user directory, instead of inside the project files
