- Racers in the underground race meet now have varying levels of performance upgrades to their cars
- Tweaked performance upgrade benefits
- Added classes to cars and racers
	- When a racer is generated, a "class" value is generated. This class determines how much money and what car they have. Higher class racers have more money for betting and more expensive/faster cars.
